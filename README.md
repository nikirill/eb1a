# EB-1A petition template

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my approved US green card DYI petition under the EB-1A category. Read my [blog post](https://nikirill.com/post/greencard/) for the description of the content and see the final PDFs for the [I-140](https://nikirill.com/files/i140.pdf) and [I-485](https://nikirill.com/files/i485.pdf) parts.

The template is derived from [the template of Razvan Marinescu](https://github.com/razvanmarinescu/EB1A).
