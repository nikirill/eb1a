Dear USCIS Officer:

\vspace{1em}

This letter is respectfully submitted in support of the petition of \drfull for
classification as a qualified immigrant under the first preference employment
immigration for Aliens of Extraordinary Ability pursuant to section 203(b)(1)(A)
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“the Act”).
This evidence shows that \dr is an alien of  extraordinary ability in the
sciences, specifically in \underline{\dpcs}, who sustained national and
international acclaim and his achievements have been recognized in the field of
his expertise.
More precisely, this letter provides evidence that:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \dr satisfies \textbf{\uline{four}} of the ten criteria listed in 8 CFR, Section 204.5(h)(3), namely:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Evidence of \drs original scientific and scholarly contributions
		of major significance in the field (\cref{sec:contributions}).
		\item \drs authorship of scholarly articles in the field in professional media (\cref{sec:authorship}).
		\item Participation of \dr as a judge of the work of others in the field
		of \dpcs (\cref{sec:judging}).
		\item Evidence that \drs work has been featured in published materials
		in major professional media (\cref{sec:media}).
	\end{itemize}
	\item \drs employment has both substantial merit and of 
	national importance for the United States (\cref{sec:benefit}).
	\item \dr has sustained national and international acclaim and his
	achievements have been recognized in the field of \dpcs (\cref{sec:merits}).
\end{enumerate}

Pursuant to 8 CFR, Section 204.5(h)(1), \dr may file an I-140 visa petition for
classification under Section 203(b)(1)(A) of the Act as an alien of
extraordinary ability in the sciences on his own behalf.

Pursuant to 8 CFR, Section 204.5(h)(5), neither an offer for employment in the
United States nor a labor certification is required for this classification.

\drs work will substantially benefit the United States where he
will continue to work in the field of his expertise. 
(Please refer to the Statement from \dr detailing plans on how he intends to continue work in the United States).
