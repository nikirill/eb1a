\section{Summary of \drs achievements and qualifications}
\label{sec:summary}

\drfull is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Columbia University and the New York
Genome Center where he analyzes the leakage of sensitive information from
encrypted data and develops methods for privacy-preserving
data sharing, specifically for medical applications.
Prior to that, \dr was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Cornell University
where he conducted research on the privacy of user communications.
He received his Ph.D. in Computer and Communication Sciences from \epfl, in 2021
and his M.Sc. in Information and Communication Technology from \kth, in 2015
(see \citewb{degrees} for his educational credentials).
Each of these institutions is in the top ranks globally~\cite{universities}.

\dr is an internationally recognized expert in the field of \dpcs.
He specializes in communication security, user privacy, and the protection of
sensitive data.
\dr is known for his work on methods for protecting the properties of encrypted
data, robust protocols for private data retrieval, the design of
systems for secure software distribution, and techniques for strengthening
blockchain networks.
All these components are critical for the protection of user data and the secure
operation of modern computer systems, which has been repeatedly recognized by
the U.S. government in various executive orders~\cite{government}.

\dr has made scientific contributions of major significance to his field of
expertise.
His methods for protecting the properties of encrypted data have been
implemented in Facebook Messenger and in iMessage on Apple devices
(\cref{sec:purbs}).
\drs work on private data access for users has addressed a critical
vulnerability in the existing approaches and has brought the technology closer
to real-world deployment.
It has also spurred a series of follow-up works from other scientists worldwide
(\cref{sec:apir}).
\drs work on securing software-update systems targeted the problem of
supply-chain attacks that had become a major concern in the industry and
were recognized by the U.S. government as a national security
threat~\cite{government}.
The work influenced the design of multiple follow-up architectures for software
distribution.
The corresponding publication by \dr has been both cited more than
180 times to date and included in the curriculum of graduate courses
at several universities (\cref{sec:chainiac}).
Lastly, \dr has contributed to improving the efficiency of
blockchain networks (\cref{sec:blockchain}).

\dr has authored five peer-reviewed scientific articles that have been
published exclusively in the top-tier venues of the field, including the IEEE
Symposium on Security and Privacy, the USENIX Security Symposium, and the
Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (\cref{sec:authorship}).
The articles \dr authored have gathered \numcitations citations by
researchers throughout the United States and in numerous countries around the
world~\cite{gscholar}.

\dr has been a judge for the work of others, having been a member of the
Program Committee and a reviewer of more than \numreviews submissions to the top
conferences in computer security, data privacy and blockchain research,
including the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, the USENIX
Security Symposium, and the IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and
Cryptocurrency (\cref{sec:judging}).
In recognition of his service, \dr was invited to become a professional member
of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)~\cite{acm_membership}.
\dr also was an organizer of a conference on biomedical data privacy and
equity~\cite{recomb-prieq}. 

Major medias have published materials about \drs work (\cref{sec:media}).
ZDNET.com, a technology-focused platform with 24~million
monthly visits, covered \drs work on the protection of encryption metadata,
whereas CyberScoop.com, a platform for cybersecurity news with 6~million unique
monthly engagements, featured \drs work on the security of software-update
systems (see \citewb{media} for the articles and the readership statistics).
Furthermore, \drs work has been highlighted by multiple scientific surveys
published in professional media.

As evidenced by \emph{\textit{\numletters}} letters of support from
distinguished professors within academia and from industry scientists (enclosed
at \citewb{letter-aaa}-\citewb{letter-jjj}), his highly cited
scientific publications, his service as a reviewer for premier scientific
conferences, and the featuring of his work in major media outlets, \dr has risen
to the top of the field of \dpcs.
He has firmly established himself as a leading expert in the field, has made
a significant impact on the scientific community, and, thus, clearly meets the
criteria for the EB-1A classification.
